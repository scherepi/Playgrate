# PLAYGRATE: *IT SHOULDN'T BE SO DAMN HARD*.
![Hackatime embed](https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U083W5CCFDG/Playgrate)

Playgrate is a web app built using Svelte, Flask, Spotipy, BeautifulSoup, and a few other tools that simplifies transferring your playlists between popular music services (Spotify, Apple Music, the likes). 

Ever transitioned from using one music service to another?
It's generally an absolute pain to try desperately to reconstruct your playlists on whatever new service your job gave you a discount for this week, only to end up giving up and starting a new one *(maybe it's for the best - you and your anime music had to grow apart)*. 

My personal playlist has reached 80 hours of music already, so I know that, if I had to transition services right now, I'd probably just skip the headache and cut my ears off without a tool like Playgrate. Playgrate will feature an intuitive user experience that makes it as easy and simple as it should be to transfer playlists: just select your origin, destination, and the playlist.
